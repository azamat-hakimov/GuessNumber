## Description

**GuessNumber Web Game** is a web application where the computer randomly generates a number within a specified range (e.g., 0 to 10). The player has to guess the correct number by submitting guesses through a web interface. Feedback is provided to the player indicating whether their guess is too high or too low. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.

### Gameplay

1. The computer generates a random number.
2. The player submits a guess via the web interface.
3. The game provides feedback (too high or too low).
4. The player keeps guessing until the correct number is guessed.
5. Once guessed correctly, a congratulatory message is displayed.

## Features

- Random number generation between 0 and 10.
- Web-based user interface for player interaction.
- Real-time feedback after each guess (too high, too low).
- Congratulatory message when the correct number is guessed.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for creating the basic structure.
- **Spring Boot**: Backend framework for handling server-side logic.
- **Thymeleaf**: Template engine for rendering dynamic HTML content.
- **Java**: Programming language for backend development.

## Note on Frontend

The HTML code used in this project is very basic and simple. As I am still learning frontend development, the structure and design of the webpage are kept minimal and straightforward. I focused mainly on the backend and game logic in Java, so the frontend is intentionally simple. Future improvements to the design and functionality are welcome!

## Installation

1. Download the project files.
2. Run the project with Maven.
